    <div class="col-md-12" > 
    <p>
    Crimson Scholars is an education platform and service built to improve the efficacy, efficiency, and accessibility of supplemental education.  We connect students with highly qualified online educators and provide the technology to attend one-to-one interactive lessons.  We built our iPad app and web client from the ground up with ease of use and learning in mind.  Our students and mentors spend less time traveling or setting up and more time learning, improving, and growing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Ultimately, quality educators are the key to effective learning.  As such, we carefully select academic coaches who have years of teaching experience and student success.  Crimson Scholars' tutors are trained to diligently assess their students, reactively adjust lessons, and engage students' interests. We make sure that our students can independently work through difficult problems and develop good study habits.  We develop understanding and work ethic first; our students' results and success are a product of those skills.
